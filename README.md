# Advent of Code 2018

This year in very nooby Rust.

Code shouldn't be viewed by anyone. At least before I get a chance to look at
other people's code and ~~copy their code~~ improve my naive Rust solutions.

Run with `cargo run` or `cargo test`.

## Status

* Day 1: [OK](src/day1.rs)
* Day 2: [OK](src/day2.rs)
* Day 3: [OK](src/day3.rs)
* Day 4: [OK](src/day4.rs)
